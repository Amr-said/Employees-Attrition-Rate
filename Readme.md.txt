# Employee Attrition Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
The battle with attrition and its implications on productivity and morale is possibly the  
biggest headache that any manager will have to face. Responses to counteract and  
decrease attrition often require the manager to understand the causes and estimate the  
costs associated with staff turnover.  

In his 2009 paper, **Yazinski** identified **7 main reasons apart from salary** that contribute to  
employee turnover:  

- Employees feel the job or workplace is not what they expected.  
- There is a mismatch between the job and the person.  
- There is too little coaching and feedback.  
- There are too few growth and advancement opportunities.  
- Employees feel devalued and unrecognized.  
- Employees feel stress from overwork and have a work/life imbalance.  
- There is a loss of trust and confidence in senior leaders.  

Workforce attrition rate is an important indicator in **human resource management**, which  
can indicate outstanding issues that need to be addressed. A **low attrition rate**  
shows that the company is on the right track. On the contrary, a **high attrition rate** is  
something no company wants.
